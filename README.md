# SkypeTest
This is an old archived utility for testing VoIP systems / telephone menus - it can also act as a home-grown robo-dialer. 

# Description
This is an unmaintained utility intended to send DTMF tones over skype to test Voice-enabled menu systems.  This is simply a test harness written almost 12 years ago ... most likely better alternatives exist now.
